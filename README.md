# ForgePrograms
Simple programs I made for my use.
When using the program you will need your local tracker to meet the standard of the template provided. This is built off of the exports from J4. When using the import function, this must match the format that J4 exports from their system. For initial setup, download the template, have J4 send you your HR, run the import program from the launcher, then use whatever you currently have locally to fill in the SHR information and statuses. SHR information goes into the Location column, see the example on how it is supposed to be.
