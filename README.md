# ForgePrograms
This is a program created to assist forges in local equipment management and tracking. 

The program uses local copies provided by J4 or local trackers matching the provided template format (Blank Template.xlsx located in Examples) for signing in and out equipment, managing individual level SHRs, and generating 1150s. 
INPORT - For initial setup, use your J4 HR or manual tabulated local copy and run the import program from the launcher. then use whatever you currently have locally to fill in the SHR information and statuses. SHR information goes into the Location column, see the example on how it is supposed to be.
